
introduction: Glycation (sometimes called non-enzymatic glycosylation) is the result of the typically covalent bonding
 of a sugar molecule, such as glucose or fructose, to a protein or lipid molecule, without the controlling action of an 
enzyme. Glycation may occur either inside the body (endogenous glycation) or outside the body (exogenous glycation). 
It is a haphazard process that impairs the functioning of biomolecules, and does not require the expenditure of ATP.
 Glycosylation, in contrast, is the enzyme-mediated ATP-dependent attachment of sugars to protein or lipid molecules 
at defined sites on the target molecule. It is an important form of post-translational modification of proteins and 
is required for the functioning of the mature molecule.Glycation is the first step in the evolution of these molecules 
through a complex series of very slow reactions in the body known as Amadori reactions, Schiff base reactions, and
 Maillard reactions; which lead to advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Some AGEs are benign, but others are more 
reactive than the sugars they are derived from, and are implicated in many age-related chronic diseases such as 
cardiovascular diseases (the endothelium, fibrinogen, and collagen are damaged), Alzheimer's disease (amyloid proteins 
are side-products of the reactions progressing to AGEs), cancer (acrylamide and other side-products are released),
 peripheral neuropathy (the myelin is attacked), and other sensory losses such as deafness (due to demyelination). 
This range of diseases is the result of the very basic level at which glycations interfere with molecular and cellular 
functioning throughout the body and the release of highly oxidizing side-products such as hydrogen peroxide.




motivation:N-linked glycosylation occurs predominantly at the N-X-T/S motif, where X is
 any amino acid except proline. Not all N-X-T/S sequons are glycosylated, and
 a number of web servers for predicting N-linked glycan occupancy using sequence and/or 
residue pattern information have been developed. None of the currently available servers,
 however, utilizes protein structural information for the prediction of N-glycan occupancy
